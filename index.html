<a id="welcome-to-terminal-installer-xposed" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-terminal-installer-xposed" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Terminal Installer: Xposed</h3>

<a id="the-story-life-without-xposed" class="anchor" href="#the-story-life-without-xposed" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The story: Life without Xposed!</h3>

<p>Ever since I rooted my first android device &amp; stumbled upon xposed installer....I FELL in love with technology all over again...Yet years later when lollipop &amp; even marshmallow came out...it was getting harder &amp; harder to flash my newer devices with the xposed framework until every DAMN device that I bought either didn't have a custom recovery nor could one flash it!</p>

<p>However in the midst of all that HELL...I finally found an alterative &amp; even a safe way to flash the xposed framework for devices that are Lollipop+ &amp; do NOT have a custom recovery!</p>

<a id="terminal-installer-was-borned" class="anchor" href="#terminal-installer-was-borned" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Terminal Installer was borned!</h3>

<p>This tool can &amp; WILL install the latest version of the xposed framework on any compatible device without a recovery if sporting Lollipop+ &amp; either have "arm," "arm64," or "x86" as its ABI.</p>

<a id="side-notes" class="anchor" href="#side-notes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Side Note(s)</h3>

<p>Isn't it Obvious how my tool works?
All it does is execute a script in a terminal &amp; that's ALL...nothing special whats so ever, however MANY safety protocals are put in place to make sure the right package is downloaded &amp; finally flashed!</p>

<p>I had to modify all xposed framework packages a bit...No big changes....so updating packages manually for me won't take long to push out continous updates of Terminal Installer </p>

<p>Even though I had to throw away all the experiences that I had in developing android apps out the window &amp; start fresh because of all the changes to material design guildlines &amp; code optimization...however I did learn java all over again &amp; utilize many new libaries in my app that I will disclose soon...In all honestly it was HELL, but it was fun.</p>
