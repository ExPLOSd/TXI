Title: Terminal Installer: Xposed

Short description: 
Install the xposed framework WITHOUT a custom recovery!

Full description:
This tool REQURIES ROOT & a compatible device(check at the bottom of this page for devices that are NOT supported)

What is xposed & why do I want to install it?
"Xposed is a way to make system-level changes to your Android operating system without installing a custom ROM. All you need is root access."
-rovo89 (creator)
Stock android is always missing features & to fill that void (and your heart) xposed was made with love for pure stock android to have custom features otherwise you couldn't have imagine living on without!

OKAY! I am HOOKED...but

How does one install the xposed framework normally again?
The "normal" way was the following:

0. Gain root access
1. Install Busybox
2. for some devices unlock the bootloader
3. flash a custom recovery
4. Download the xposed framework
5. flash from the custom recovery!

WAIT a minute...that a ton to do..but...my device does NOT have a custom recovery...how can I install the xposed framework now?
That is NOT a problem anymore...IT'S SIMPLE:
0. Gain Root access
1. just install "Terminal Install: Xposed"
2. launch the installer
3. a few seconds you WILL have the xposed framework installed!

Three EASY simple steps to have the latest xposed framework installed on your device WITHOUT the hassle!

What if it is installed & want to get rid of it for no real reason?
There's also the miserable option to uninstall the xposed framework too:(

What if my device is NOT compatible with xposed...will it still install the framework anyway?
ABSOLUTELY NOT! all devices that are NOT compatible will be greeted with a sad message....(basically flipping you off!)
I worked very hard to make a tool to NEVER brick a device HOWEVER xposed & this tool are VERY experimental & should be regarded with some caution!

I found some issues with Terminal Installer...do I report it here?
NO! spamming the comments with issues/bug reports makes it harder to track issues & also makes the tool more terrible than it really is..
So that is why I utilized an awesome library for you to use to send me isssues/bug reports directly within the tool!

I found issues..but I can NOT access Terminal Installer...how do I report issues now?
If for some reason you can NOT access the tool because of a crash then tap the link below to create an issue directly from your browser! (may need to sign up to github.com)

If I have a feature request where can I ask it?
Please do NOT create an issue just for a feature request...but you can checkout my tool's plus page for that & many more @ https://plus.google.com/communities/101286674025561115431

Incompatible devices list:
1. All SAMSUNG devices-due to Samsung's changes to ART...HOWEVER there are unofficial builds that work around this by deodexing and adjusting the ROM.
2. Non-arm or non-arm64 or non-x86 device
3. a certain Dell Venue 8 7840(probably more)
4. some stock Sony roms seem to have been shipped with corrupted services.odex (the embedded .dex is invalid). Those ROMs will bootloop with a "Fatal signal 6" or "No pending exception expected: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException" error...check this isssue here...https://github.com/rovo89/Xposed/issues/64

side notes:
This tool would NOT have existed WITHOUT the ground breaking work of rovo89 who created xposed & the many who helped made it what it is today!
