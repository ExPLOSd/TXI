  "body": "### Welcome to Terminal Installer: Xposed\r\n\r\n###The story: Why I created Terminal Installer: Xposed\r\n\r\nEver since I rooted my first android device & stumbled upon xposed installer....I FELL in love with technology all over again...Yet after lollipop & even marshmallow came out...it was getting harder & harder to flash my newer devices with the xposed framework until every DAMN device that I bought either didn't have a custom recovery nor could one flash it!\r\n\r\nHOWEVER in the midst of all that HELL...I finally found an alterative & even a safe way to install the xposed framework!\r\n\r\n### Terminal Installer was borned!\r\n\r\nThis tool can & WILL install the latest version of the xposed framework on any compatible device without a recovery if sporting Lollipop+ & either have \"arm,\" \"arm64,\" or \"x86\" as its ABI.\r\n\r\n###Features\r\n\r\n1. Install:) & Uninstall:( the xposed framework latest version.\r\n2. Device Compatibility checker & blocker for incompatible devices.\r\n3. Tamper-proof methods to never execute modified installer & uninstaller scripts(or try to execute foreign scripts)\r\n4. Have an issue? report it directly inside of Terminal Installer!\r\n5. feature request here(maybe)\r\n\r\n###Incompatible devices list:\r\n\r\n1. All SAMSUNG devices\r\n2. Non-arm or non-arm64 or non-x86 devices\r\n3. a certain Dell Venue 8 7840(probably more)\r\n4. some stock Sony roms...however ALL Sony devices will be blocked from flashing xposed until the fatal bootloop is fixed!\r\n\r\n\r\n###Side Note(s)\r\n\r\nIsn't it Obvious how my tool works?\r\nAll it does is execute a script in a terminal & that's ALL...nothing special whats so ever, however MANY safety protocals are put in place to make sure the right package is downloaded & finally flashed!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@Xstar97\r\n\r\n### Open-Source Libraries utilized\r\n1.
