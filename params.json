All SAMSUNG devices\r\n2. Non-arm or non-arm64 or non-x86 devices\r\n3. a certain Dell Venue 8 7840(probably more)\r\n4. some stock Sony roms...however ALL Sony devices will be blocked from flashing xposed until the fatal bootloop is fixed!\r\n\r\n###Side Note(s)\r\n\r\nIsn't it Obvious how my tool works?\r\nAll it does is execute a script in a terminal & that's ALL...nothing special whats so ever, however MANY safety protocals are put in place to make sure the right package is downloaded & finally flashed!\r\n\r\n##In order for my app to function...\r\nI modified all xposed framework packages a bit...No big changes....so updating packages manually for me won't take long to push out continuous updates of Terminal Installer: Xposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@Xstar97\r\n\r\n### Open-Source Libraries utilized\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or troubleshooting?\r\nHaving trouble with Terminal Installer?
